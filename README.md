## Machine Learning Model Used

I have used **KNN** , **Decision Tree Classifier** , **Random Forest** & **XG Boost** algorithms on the KDD dataset which when compared to the deep learning models has given us quite low accuracies.

## SMOTE

I have applied the SMOTE algorithm in order to generate new duplicate samples. I have performed a case where I've upsampled the minority class in order to balance the dataset. 

## Deep Learning Model Used

I have also implemented one of the deep learning models i.e **ANN** which has given me the highest accuracy which is around **0.99**.

## Association Rule Mining Model Used

Built an **Apriori** which is an algorithm used for **Association Rule Mining**. It searches for a series of frequent sets of items in the datasets.
